# Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset** to classify tumors as **malignant or benign** and explore feature relationships.

## Dataset

The dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.  These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.  The goal is to predict whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).

## Key Libraries
- pandas, numpy
- sklearn (scikit-learn)
- matplotlib, seaborn
